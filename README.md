Polymer Gopher
==============

This project is a sample web application hosted on [App Engine][1] composed of
two [App Engine modules][2]:

- a frontend written using [Polymer][3]
- a backend written in [Go][4]

## Running locally

To run this application locally install the [Go App Engine SDK][7] and then execute:

```
$ goapp serve dispatch.yaml frontend/app.yaml backend/app.yaml
```

## Deploying the app on the cloud

And to deploy it:

- Create a new Google Cloud project on the [Google Cloud Console][8]

- Write your project id in every single `yaml` file:

```yaml
	application: your-application-id
```

- Then execute

```
$ goapp deploy backend/app.yaml
$ goapp deploy frontend/app.yaml
$ appcfg.py update_dispatch .
```

Then visiting http://your-project-id.appspot.com should show you the application
running on the cloud.

The documentation generated for the Go backend is available on [godoc.org][10].
